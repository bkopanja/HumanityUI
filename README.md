# HumanityUI
This is simple app written over 2 days in order to try to create simple yet beautiful app that fetches images from Flickr

# Note
I did not do this "by book" and I probably took some shortcuts while making the app, as I was determined to finish it as soon as possible, while making it to be as best as possible, so don't use it as a guide how to do programming, rather use it for fun :)
